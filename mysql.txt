Greetings!

In addition to your SVN repository, all COMS 309 groups
have been allocated a MySQL database. If you don't need 
a database for your project, then you can ignore this.

=== Database Connection Details ===
server:		mysql.cs.iastate.edu
database:	db309M13
username:	u309M13
password:	T2GWRYDIw

If you are using the MySQL command line utilities, you
can connect to the server with the following command:

  mysql -h mysql.cs.iastate.edu -u u309M13 -p db309M13
  (You will then be prompted for your password.)
